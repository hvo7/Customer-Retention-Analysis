After performing RFM analysis, we will now use SQL to answer the following hypotheses:

H1: Customers who buy multiple product categories are more likely to return.

H2: Customers who make their first purchase in December have lower retention.

H3: The average days between purchases is shorter for loyal customers.

H4: High-frequency customers tend to purchase fewer items per order but more often.

H5: Customers in Segment X (e.g., RFM 555) increased spending after the campaign.

H6: Customers who were emailed are more likely to return within 30 days.

H7: Customers who received a discount coupon have higher frequency post-campaign.

H8: Customers who havenâ€™t purchased in 90+ days are unlikely to return.

H9: Customers with only 1 purchase have a 70%+ chance of not returning.

H10: Customers with low Quantity per Invoice are more likely to churn.

/*   Problems I encountered in the dataset or way it transferred


-- P1: Identified that some rows for description are more than just blank, also contains tabs, zero-width space, etc. - Reformat Description

-- Query that identified problem

Replace all the tabs, non-breaking space, etc. with empty space so that TRIM works
