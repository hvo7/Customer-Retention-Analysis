# Project Goals
### Problem Statement
Which customers should the company prioritize for a targeted marketing campaign to improve customer retention and maximize revenue over the next 6 months?

The purpose of this project is to identify customers who are at the highest risk of churning such that a targeting campaign would optimize the company's resources. 


### Stakeholder Questions
1. How should we prioritize customers for marketing campaign?
2. How can we measure whether the campaign improves retention or revenue?
3. How can we tell which customers are likely to stop buying from us soon?
4. What characteristics do high-rentention vs. low-retention customers have?
5. Who are our most valuable customers based on their purchasing behavior?
