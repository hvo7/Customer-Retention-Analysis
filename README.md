# Summary 

# Introduction
A retailer company named "Simple Product Co." aims to improve customer retention and increase revenue. To do this, they plan to execute a marketing campaign. Often times, because retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones, they are in need of determining which customers are at highest risk of churning and thus are prime targets. By focusing efforts on the right customers that are most likely to churn, the company can maximize ROI on marketing spend. I hope to use **Tableau** to provide a dashboard that helps non-technical stakeholders target key customers and demonstrates monthly customer retention. I will also use **SQL** to validate existing hypotheses and assumptions regarding customer retention to help provide further investigation as to **How the company can increase customer retention**. 

# Key Insights
Our dataset includes the company's order history over the period of 13 months (Dec 2010 - Dec 2011). 
I targeted and ranked specific customers using <u> Recency, Frequency, and monetary value analysis (RFM Analysis). </u> The assumptions for RFM Analysis is that:
1. Recent customers are more likely to return.
2. Frequent Buyers tend to be loyal customers
3. High Spenders result in a higher ROI to retain - Useful when targeting not only <u> loyal </u> but also <u> high-value </u> customers

I also quantified the company's overall customer retention using 3 primary metrics:
* Customer Retention Rate (CRR)
* Customer Churn Rate 
* Repeated Purchase Rate (RPR)
